## Description
ðŸŒŸ On one hand, umapp is born to connect users with dogs and dog trainers. Sometimes it can be difficult to find a dog trainer in your city, and you don't know where to start.

ðŸŒŸ On the other hand, umapp aims to solve and digitize the management of dog trainers with their clients, allowing for tracking that serves both parties.
